This photo was taken at night at the EDU, with a bright and round moon hanging in the dark sky. Surrounding the moon are clouds illuminated by its light. The teaching building on the left is lit up, and at the bottom of the image, there is a flower bud that has not yet bloomed, with dense leaves on its left side. This is my favorite picture! It has a wonderful atmosphere, and I hope you understand what I mean, because I certainly do.
