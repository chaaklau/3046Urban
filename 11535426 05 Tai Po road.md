This is a photo I took while sitting on the EDU bus on the way to university. The sunshine is wonderful and warm, making the grass and trees appear especially vibrant and green. Additionally, on this sign, you can see the direction to the univercity, and the image captures a fork in the road that I find quite poetic. There is a car driving on one path, while I am heading in the opposite direction.
