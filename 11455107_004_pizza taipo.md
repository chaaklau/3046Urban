Today was a Free Pizza Day in EdUHK, so everyone from staff to student grabbed the chance for some food, because...
Number 1: Who would not say no to free food?
Number 2: EdUHK does not have much meal options to offer in its main campus.
So everyone might consider this as a "one-in-a-lifetime" opportunity.
