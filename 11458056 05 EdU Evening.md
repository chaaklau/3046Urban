Though I'm not someone who's obsessed with photography, clouds are something that I can't restrict myself from taking a phone and capture the splendid view created by those beautifully arranged clouds and fascinating lightning. This scene was taken at EdU during the evening period. The sky, to me, built up a special atmosphere that I'd never felt before in the campus.
