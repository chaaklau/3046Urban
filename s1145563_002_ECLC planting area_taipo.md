This vibrant image showcases the planting area at ECLC, a space dedicated to nurturing young minds through hands-on gardening activities. Rows of potted plants, lovingly tended by children, reflect their curiosity and care. This initiative not only teaches them about plant life but also encourages responsibility and creativity. The children's work is proudly displayed outside, allowing them to share their achievements with parents and peers. This engaging environment fosters a deeper connection with nature, inspiring a lifelong appreciation for the natural world.
