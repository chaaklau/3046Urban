In EdUHK, there are a fair share of locker decorations you may come across.
Some are cute, some are encouraging, while some are what we consider "unhinged".
This photo of Gojo is an example of an "unhinged" decoration.
Perhaps owner of the locker intended it to be a reference to Jujutsu Kaisen. But I am not fully certain on the notion as I have not read nor watched it.
