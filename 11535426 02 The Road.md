This photo was taken on the road leading up to the school. Because it's an uphill route, and there are schools and residences on the mountain, there is a speed limit sign of 50 standing there to remind drivers. The surrounding area is filled with dense trees, creating a very comfortable atmosphere. On the left, there's a small path for pedestrians, which is very user-friendly.
