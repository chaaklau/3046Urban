Waiting for the classroom to open, but then you see a suspicious sign.
The sign that somehow piqued your interest to the point that you might wanna sneak a peak inside.
As you peaked through the window, you do not see anyone.
Quite disappointing, to say the least.
You sort of expect to find someone doing an interview but only found an empty classroom with dim lights.
