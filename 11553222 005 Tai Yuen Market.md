opened in 1980, this was one of the first indoor public markets in Tai Po. By the time it had reached its 30th birthday, however, it was only half as busy, with vacant stalls and maintenance problems. That led to an ambitious renovation that gave the market a complete makeover, doing away with crowded, narrow aisles and adopting a more inviting, aesthetically pleasing design. Today, there’s a broad mix of tenants, from greengrocers to fishmongers and delicatessens, and there’s even a rooftop farm that produces fresh vegetables. Stay for lunch at one of the 10 cooked food stalls.
