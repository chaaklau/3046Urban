This is a spot I took in Luk Keng, whihc is famous as a hiking spot and local restaurant inside the village of it. I went hiking with my family and this ia one of the restaurant that we had our luch after we walked inside to the village. There are fields and grass and local houses. The sky is full of clouds that it is not really hot, it was a perfect weather for hiking and we had a great time.
