Wild boars appear mainly in rural areas and are perceived as a threat to human livings because of its potential attack on humans. EdU is far from the city centre of Tai Po, which qualifies for being located in a suburban or even a rural area. That's why it is common to see wild boars. The wild boar appearing in the picture did not attack humans, but rather focusing on rummaging through trash bins for food, which is kinda sad.
