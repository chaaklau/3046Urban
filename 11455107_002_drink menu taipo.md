Before the udeli food stall went under renovation, it was a popular food place for EdUHK staff and students.
For some reason, I have no idea why I felt more pressured to order a drink when I simply wanted to order a box of siumai.
But it is fine because the drinks are decent while enjoying a nice udeli meal.
I hope the food stall finishes renovating soon, I want to try their food and drinks again.
