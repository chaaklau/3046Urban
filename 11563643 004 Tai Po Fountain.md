This is a cute and short fountain in the campus, it doesn't match the atmosphere, could the fountain be a little more bigger like the Hong Kong Dislanyland fountain in the entrance? playing some sort of songs and music, putting on a light show? It looks like a western vintage thing, maybe it is related to fengshui or vastu but the water flows gently and sounds healing. It makes me think of the Tsz Shan Monastery near the school.
