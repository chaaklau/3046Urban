This flower is a Hibiscus rosa-sinensis. It blooms brightly in the morning. The other name for the flower is China rose. Due to curiosity, I went to check why do these kind of flower species bloom in winter. Aren't they cold? It turns out this flower is the country flower of Malaysia! It was long ago before she declared her independence. Hibiscus rosa-sinensis represents peace, hope and happiness. This is fascinating and reminds me of Hong Kong's region flower is the Bauhinia blakeana. Also in pink.
