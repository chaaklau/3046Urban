This photo was taken at the G floor of Block B in the EDU, with a distant view of rolling hills and a staircase in the foreground. The most striking feature of this image is the reflection of the colorful clouds in the sky on the window, along with the thin clouds above. It clearly shows that the EDU has a great environment, where the beauty of nature can often be seen.
