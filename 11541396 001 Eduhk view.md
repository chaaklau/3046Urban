The sunlight was shining through the leaves, creating beautiful patterns on the ground. In the distance, the mountains were layered, with mist swirling around them, looking just like a watercolor painting. A gentle breeze brushed by, carrying the scent of flowers, which really lifted my spirits. It was such a lovely afternoon!
