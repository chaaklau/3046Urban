This picture shows the Plover Cove reservoir near the country park. where we can feel some sort of sea breeze and see some yacht and small ships with mountains behind. Sometimes I would think if the reservoir can be developed into a nature park and attract more people to Tai Po and Edu might have a mtr station of students. It also makes me wonder if the sun sets there. Could we eat congee there? Is there famous for shrimp paste like Tai O?
