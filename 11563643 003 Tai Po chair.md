This wooden swing chair is the best place the take a nap under the sun in the cold winter, putting on earphones playing your favourite song during breaks, with a hot chocolate in hand. There are stll other chairs but this is the best spot becuase nearly no people walks to these far away blocks. I would have deep talks with my friends and take turns to push each other.
