This is the ECLC located near EDUHK, the visit took place in year 1, we learnt about the curriculum and the teaching style of the early childhood learning center.
through the visit, I learnt that the center's curriculum promotes learning through exploration and concrete experiences, and provides a learning environment that emphasizes development in both the cognitive and affective domains.
the design of the center is very child-friendly and it can be seen that the children enjoy their time at the center learning through many different ways.
